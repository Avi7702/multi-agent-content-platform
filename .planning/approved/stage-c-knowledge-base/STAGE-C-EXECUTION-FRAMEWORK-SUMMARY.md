**File**: [STAGE-C-EXECUTION-TRACKER.md](STAGE-C-EXECUTION-TRACKER.md)
**Framework**: Milestone-Kanban Hybrid with Weekly OKRs
**Timeline**: 5 weeks (25 working days)

**What's Inside**:

#### Executive Dashboard
- Real-time project metrics (progress, velocity, budget, bugs)
- Status indicators (✅ Complete, 🟢 On Track, ⚠️ At Risk, 🔴 Critical, ⏸ Blocked)

#### 5 Weekly Milestones
Each milestone has:
- ✅ **Clear exit criteria** (measurable, specific)
- ✅ **Evidence requirements** (proof of completion)
- ✅ **Blocker tracking** (what's preventing progress)
- ✅ **Contingency plans** (what if we fail)

**Week 1**: Web Scraping Infrastructure
**Week 2**: Knowledge Extraction Engine (GPT-5)
**Week 3**: Auto-Categorization & Embeddings
**Week 4**: Gap Detection & Validation
**Week 5**: Integration & MCP Tools

#### Critical Path Analysis
```
START → [Credentials] → Week 1 (Scraping) → Week 2 (Extraction) →
Week 3 (Categorization) → Week 4 (Gap Detection) → Week 5 (Integration) → END
```

**Current Status**: ⏸ BLOCKED at START (credentials pending)

#### Parallel Work Opportunities
Identified tasks that can run concurrently:
- Database schema design ← **CAN START NOW** (no dependencies)
- Test dataset preparation ← **CAN START NOW** (no dependencies)
- Embedding model research ← **CAN START EARLY**
- MCP tool planning ← **CAN START EARLY**

#### Weekly OKRs
Each week has:
- **Objective**: What we're trying to achieve
- **Key Results**: How we measure success (3 measurable KRs)
- **Initiatives**: Specific tasks to complete

Example (Week 2):
- **Objective**: Extract structured knowledge from scraped content
- **KR1**: 10 pages extracted with >75% category accuracy
- **KR2**: Batch extraction completes in <80 seconds (10 pages)
- **KR3**: >80% of entries have confidence >0.7
